(4/25) Please visit my [new website](https://xingyu-qu.notion.site/).

I'm currently a second-year master's student at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), fortunately, to be supervised by Dr. [Samuel Horvath](https://sites.google.com/view/samuelhorvath). My research interests lie in understanding the science of deep learning and translating obtained insights into better practice. Ideally, I want to engage in research that is both interesting and meaningful. Before this, I got my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/).
